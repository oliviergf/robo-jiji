## robo-jiji

Fun little project that i've made in the beginning of 2020.

It's basically a bot that crawls Kijiji and fetches all photos and infos about newly posted apartements in Montr√©al.
The goal was to let users draw geographic zones on google map page and send them notifications whenever a new 
posting could be found in one of their zones. 

The project failed when kijiji locked us out of their site for crawling it.
At that point, the whole project was almost ready to be put into production but still needed some touch-ups.

Nevertheless, i learned a lot and had some fun during the process :)
