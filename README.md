## robo-jiji

Fun little project that i've made in the beginning of 2020.

It's basically a bot that crawls Kijiji and fetches all photos and infos about newly posted apartements in Montr√©al.
The goal was to let users draw geographic zones on google map page and send them notifications whenever a new 
posting could be found in one of their zones. 

I lost interest in the project when kijiji locked us out of their site for crawling it. I didn't want to setup rotating proxies to evade their IP ban.
At that point, the whole project was almost ready to be releash in beta to a few friends who needed it.

Nevertheless, i learned a lot and had some fun during the process :)
